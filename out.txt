Levi Strauss, the US clothing group, has hired an outside law firm to investigate allegations of tax and accounting irregularities made by two former employees. The markets regulator, the securities and exchange commission, has also opened an informal inquiry into the claims. 
The company's audit committee ordered the fresh investigation after the men, Robert Schmidt and Thomas Walsh, filed a lawsuit in April accusing the firm of filing false financial statements since 1997. They claimed they were fired from the company for refusing to conceal the accounting irregularities. 
The complaint alleged that a partnership set up in Brazil was an illegal tax shelter, which enabled Levi's to book hundreds of millions of dollars in deductions and income. They claim that two auditors at the accounting firm KPMG who questioned the tax scheme were removed at Levi's request. 
Levi's has denied the allegations and countersued the two former employees, accusing them of a "conspiracy" to make "false misleading and defamatory statements" about the company. 
The clothing maker hired a lawyer to review allegations made by the pair in an inquiry conducted in December and January. But the company said the lawsuit had prompted a wider investigation. Spokeswoman Linda Butler said: "When the lawsuit was filed there were very specific claims of tax fraud and as a result the audit committee is seeking expert opinion. We are comfortable that our tax positions are appropriate but this is an extra precautionary measure." 
She denied a report that the new investigation had been ordered because the audit committee was not satisfied that the first inquiry had been independent or thorough. 
In April, Levi's chief executive Philip Marineau defended the company. He said Levi's tax accounting was "accurate and appropriate" and said the allegations had been proven to be unfounded after "a thorough and independent investigation using outside legal counsel and our outside auditors."
